A Vite + React frontend for the Group 2 Voice Technology project. It provides voice and password-based authentication along with a chatbot experience powered by voice interactions.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast dev tooling and build pipeline
- [React 18](https://react.dev/) with TypeScript for UI development
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for API communication
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for client-side routing

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm installed

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root if it does not exist:

```bash
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env
```

This URL should point to the backend service. Update it when running against a different environment.

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app is available at `http://localhost:5173` by default. Hot reloading is enabled for rapid development.

### 5. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready output is generated in the `dist/` directory.
